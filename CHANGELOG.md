## 6.0.1 - *2021-06-01*

## 5.2.0 - *2021-02-26*

## 5.1.0 (2019-09-30)

- The running user is now calculated at converge time which prevents failures on systems that don't have the nscd package before the chef-client run has started.
- Columns in the config are now somewhat aligned, which prevents a hard to read diff on the first chef-client run
- Added Ubuntu 18.04 / Debian 10 testing to Travis
- Added support and testing for openSUSE 42 / 15

## 5.0.2 (2018-04-04)

- Remove apt from the Berksfile
- Travis: Test the custom resource and test Debian
- Resolve Chef 14 deprecation

## 5.0.1 (2018-02-15)

- Test with delivery local mode and cleanup the test cookbook
- Don't use kind\_of in the custom resource (FC117)
- Fix a bad example in the readme

## 5.0.0 (2017-02-23)

- Require Chef 12.5+ and remove compat\_resource dependency

## v4.1.0 (2016-06-10)

- Add a new attribute 'template\_cookbook' to allow specifying a cookbook containing the nscd config template for wrapper cookbooks

## v4.0.0 (2016-05-12)

- The NSCD user / group is now set to nscd if the nscd user/group exist and if not it will run as nobody. This is most likely the desired behavior for users, but may be a surprise based on the previous behavior.

## v3.0.0 (2016-04-29)

- NSCD database values are now sanitized to remove incompatible databases on RHEL < 6 and Debian < 8\. services and netgroup will now be removed as necessary

## v2.0.0 (2015-10-24)

- Breaking change: Changed the execute block for performing nscd database cache clears in wrapper cookbooks to a Chef 12.5 custom resource that can more easily clear the cache for multiple databases. This will require updating cookbooks that notified to the previous execute block and requires Chef 12.0 or greater.
